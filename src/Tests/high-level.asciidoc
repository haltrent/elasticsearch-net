= NEST - High level client

[partintro]
--
The high level client, `ElasticClient`, provides a strongly typed query DSL that maps one-to-one with the Elasticsearch query DSL.

It can be installed from the Package Manager Console inside Visual Studio using

[source, shell]
----
Install-Package NEST
----

Or by searching for https://www.nuget.org/packages/NEST[NEST] in the Package Manager GUI. 

NEST internally uses and still exposes the low level client, `ElasticLowLevelClient`, from <<elasticsearch-net,Elasticsearch.Net>> via
the `.LowLevel` property on `ElasticClient`.

There are a number of conventions that NEST uses for inference of

- <<index-name-inference, Index Names>>
- <<indices-paths, Building a URI path to one or more indices>>
- <<field-inference, Field names>> and <<property-inference, Property names>>
- <<ids-inference, Document IDs>>
- <<document-paths, Building a URI path to a document>>
- <<features-inference, API features>>

As well as a number of types for working with

- <<time-units, Time Units>>
- <<distance-units, Distance Units>>
- <<date-math-expressions, Date Math>>

And features such as

- <<auto-map, Auto Mapping C# types>>
- <<covariant-search-results, Covariant Search Results>>

[[thrown-exceptions]]
== Exceptions
There are three categories of exceptions that may be thrown:

`ElasticsearchClientException`:: These are known exceptions, either an exception that occurred in the request pipeline
(such as max retries or timeout reached, bad authentication, etc...) or Elasticsearch itself returned an error (could
not parse the request, bad query, missing field, etc...). If it is an Elasticsearch error, the `ServerError` property
on the response will contain the the actual error that was returned.  The inner exception will always contain the
root causing exception.

`UnexpectedElasticsearchClientException`:: These are unknown exceptions, for instance a response from Elasticsearch not
properly deserialized.  These are sometimes bugs and {github}/issues[should be reported]. This exception also inherits from `ElasticsearchClientException`
so an additional catch block isn't necessary, but can be helpful in distinguishing between the two.

Development time exceptions:: These are CLR exceptions like `ArgumentException`, `ArgumentOutOfRangeException`, etc.
that are thrown when an API in the client is misused.  The `.ThrowExceptions()` setting has no bearing on these as
they will always be thrown, and also should not be handled by a consumer.
