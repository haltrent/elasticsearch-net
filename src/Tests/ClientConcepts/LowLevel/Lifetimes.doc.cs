		/**== Lifetimes
		*
		* If you are using an IOC/Dependency Injection container, it's always useful to know the best practices around 
        * the lifetime of your objects.
		*
		* In general we advise folks to register their `ElasticClient` instances as singletons. The client is thread safe
		* so sharing an instance between threads is fine.
		*
		* The actual moving part that benefits the most from being static for most of the duration of your
		* application is `ConnectionSettings`; **caches are __per__ `ConnectionSettings`**.
		*
		* In some applications it could make perfect sense to have multiple singleton `ElasticClient`'s registered with different
		* connection settings. e.g if you have 2 functionally isolated Elasticsearch clusters.
		*
		* IMPORTANT: Due to the semantic versioning of Elasticsearch.Net and NEST and their alignment to versions of Elasticsearch, all instances of `ElasticClient` and
		* Elasticsearch clusters that are connected to must be on the **same major version** i.e. it is not possible to have both an `ElasticClient` to connect to
		* Elasticsearch 1.x _and_ 2.x in the same application as the former would require NEST 1.x and the latter, NEST 2.x.
		*
		* Let's demonstrate which components are disposed by creating our own derived `ConnectionSettings`, `IConnectionPool` and `IConnection` types
