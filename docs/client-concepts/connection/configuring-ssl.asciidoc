=== Configuring SSL

SSL can be configured via the `ServerCertificateValidationCallback` property on 

* `ServerPointManager` for Desktop CLR

* `HttpClientHandler` for Core CLR

On the Desktop CLR, this must be done outside of the client using .NET's built-in http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.servicepointmanager%28v=vs.110%29.aspx[ServicePointManager] class:

The bare minimum to make .NET accept self-signed SSL certs that are not in the  https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc754841(v=ws.11).aspx[Trusted Root Certificate Authorities store]
is to have the `ServerCertificateValidationCallback` callback simply return `true`

[source,csharp]
----
ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback += (sender, cert, chain, errors) => true;
----

[WARNING]
--
This will accept **all** requests from the AppDomain to untrusted SSL sites,
therefore **we recommend doing some minimal introspection on the passed in certificate.**
